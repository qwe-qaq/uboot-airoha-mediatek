 * Failsafe Web UI - boot mode of the running session.
 *
 * A bootloader can run either from the flash (its own image was stored there
 * by the boot chain) or from RAM, when the image was fetched over the console
 * by the previous boot stage (the TF-A BL2 XMODEM recovery on Airoha, the
 * BootROM XMODEM path on EcoNet).  The second case is a volatile recovery
 * session: nothing the user uploads through the network reaches the flash
 * until it is written explicitly, so forgetting to flash a bootloader - or
 * installing a firmware that does not match the bootloader already in the
 * flash - bricks the device on the next reset.  The Web UI warns about it,
 * see main.js and the "boot" field of GET /sysinfo.
 *
 * The mode is reported by the boot chain where it can be reported at all
 * (see <soc/airoha/bootsrc.h>); everywhere else it stays "unknown" and the
 * Web UI stays quiet instead of guessing.
