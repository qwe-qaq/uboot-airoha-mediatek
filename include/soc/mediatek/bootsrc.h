/*
 * MediaTek boot source reporting.
 *
 * The BL2 of the MediaTek TF-A port publishes where the FIP it finally
 * booted came from, so that BL33 (U-Boot) can tell a normal flash boot from
 * a RAM recovery boot - the case in which the FIP was pushed into DRAM over
 * the console (bl2_boot_ram.c, or an XMODEM recovery that replaced the
 * stored FIP) and never reached the flash.
 *
 * That session is volatile: nothing uploaded through the network is stored
 * unless it is written explicitly, so forgetting to flash a bootloader - or
 * installing a firmware that does not match the bootloader already in the
 * flash - bricks the device on the next reset.  The Web failsafe warns
 * about it, see <failsafe/boot_mode.h>.
 *
 * The value travels through the standard image description arguments:
 * BL2 puts it in BL33's entry point arguments, BL31 hands that description
 * over untouched and the AArch64 startup code stores the register in
 * save_boot_params() (see arch/arm/mach-mediatek/boot_params.S).  A boot
 * chain that does not publish anything (an older BL2) leaves it zero, which
 * is reported as "unknown" and keeps U-Boot quiet.
